This use case shows how to specify Quantum4BPMN workflow models independent of a quantum computer by using a *QuantumHardwareSelectionSubprocess*.
The quantum computer is then automatically selected during workflow runtime, and the QuantME modeling constructs within the QuantumHardwareSelectionSubprocess are dynamically replaced by suitable workflow fragments based on the selected quantum computer.

The following figure shows a workflow model implementing Simon's algorithm:
