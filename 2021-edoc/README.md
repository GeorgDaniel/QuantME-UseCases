## Setting up the MODULO Framework

First, we will discuss the steps required to set up the different components comprising the MODULO framework.
All components except the [QuantME Transformation Framework](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/QuantME-TransformationFramework) providing the graphical BPMN modeler are available via Docker.
Therefore, these components can be started using the Docker-Compose file available [here](./docker):

1. Update the [.env](./docker/.env) file with your settings: 
  * ``PUBLIC_HOSTNAME``: Enter the hostname/IP address of your Docker engine. Do *not* use ``localhost``.

2. Run the Docker-Compose file:
```
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Wait until all containers are up and running. This may take some minutes.

To start the QuantME Transformation Framework, please execute the following steps:

1. Clone the repository using release v1.3.0: 
```
git clone https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/QuantME-TransformationFramework.git --branch v1.3.0
```

2. Move to the cloned folder and build the framework:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

3. The build product can be found in the ``dist`` folder and started depending on the operating system, e.g., using the ``.exe`` for Windows.

Afterwards, the following screen should be displayed:
